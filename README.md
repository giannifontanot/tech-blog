# Tech Blog
This project is about creating a blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. It follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Installation
This project uses many packages from NPM. 
- app-root-path 
- connect-session-sequelize 
- express 
- express-handlebars 
- memorystore 
- mysql2 
- bcrypt 
- dotenv 
- express-session 
- sequelize

## Usage
The user can browse the blog without authentication, but if he or she wants to post or comment about other 
people's posts, then a login is needed. The site is very easy to navigate. There is an option to create a new user, in 
case someone wants to contribute but is not registered yet.
